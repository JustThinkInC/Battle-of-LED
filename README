BATTLE OF LED, 1914
--George K & Theo Harbers

For compiling and running on a Linux machine do the following steps:
1) Compile the game, this will produce .hex, .o, and .bin files:
    make
2) Compile and run the game on the avr:
    make program


Playing the game:
1) Scrolling title text will appear, simply push down the joystick to start the 
   game.
2) Every player has a trench and 30 bullets (more than enough!), every sandbag
   has 2 hit points (HP), each bullet deals 1 damage HP. Every player has only
   1 HP. Objective is to capture opponent's trench or take them down.
3) Move by pushing the joystick in the desired direction.
4) Push to shoot
5) When game is over, scrolling text will notify you of the outcome, 
   push joystick to return to the menu.
6) There is an "Easter" egg, find it! Tis probably the best outcome (hint hint)
   Reading the code to find the Easter egg does not mean you've found it :)
